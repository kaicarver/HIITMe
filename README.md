HIIT Me S1-S12
==============

This is an exact clone of Alex Gilleran's exellent open source HIIT Me interval training app, with the addition of the S1-S12 program for convenience. It saves people the trouble of entering all 12 steps themselves. I plan to modify the app some more to make training programs exportable and shareable, but for now this will have to do.

This is the S1-S12 program, which helps you to learn to run without stopping for 30 minutes in 12 sessions:

This cloned app has been published to the Play Store here:

This is Alex Gilleran's original README:

Back in 2013 I was looking for a job and I thought it'd be fun to crank out a quick interval timer to prove that I knew Android. All the timers I'd used in the play store (and there are literally dozens) were quick, dirty jobs with one or more terrible problems, and I wanted something that actually worked. The problem was that

A) Android, as I slowly learned, is a painfully treacherous and unproductive platform and
B) If I wanted this to show that I wasn't a terrible developer I'd actually need to put in some effort to make it decent

As a result I didn't quite finish it in the next few weeks... in fact I basically only worked on it in bursts here or there and it stretched on for two years before I finally got inspired to finish the damn thing. You can find it on the play store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alexgilleran.hiitme, or you can type "HIIT Me" into the play store search then scroll down to the 47th result :(.
